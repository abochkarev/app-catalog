          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
          ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine,
          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.
